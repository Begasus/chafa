Chafa releases
==============

1.0.1 (2018-12-18)
------------------

* Bug fixes:
  [unfiled]  Bad geometry calculation when specifying one dimension
             and omitting the other.

1.0.0 (2018-12-16)
------------------

This release adds features, greatly improves performance and fixes
several bugs. Programs written for the command line and libchafa
interfaces in this release will be supported by future versions in
the 1.y.z series without the need for modification or recompilation.

* Added ability to specify "fill" symbols to use as halftone for better
  color approximation. This can be used to augment the regular symbol
  selection or to replace it (with --symbols none) for a different,
  purely intensity-based effect.

* Improved preprocessing in 2-color and 16-color modes. This is optional
  (default: on) and consists of a contrast boost and, for the 16-color
  mode, an additional saturation boost. The new implementation lives in
  libchafa and does not rely on ImageMagick. It is multithreaded, and due
  to its specialized nature, much faster.

* Added --watch option to continuously monitor a file.

* Added more symbols:
  - Most of the ASCII range.
  - Braille range (github#2, thanks to Adam Borowski).
  - Miscellaneous math and scanline symbols.
  - More geometric symbols (black circle, triangles) (Mo Zhou).

* Throughput improvements:
  - Fast symbol candidate set reduction by median cut.
  - Parallel processing with threads.
  - Prescaling using bilinear interpolation instead of lanczos.

* Installation instructions:
  - New: Arch (github#12, Felix Yan).
  - New: Debian testing/unstable (github#9, Mo Zhou).
  - New: Fedora (github#14, Ricardo Arguello).
  - Mention missing dependency for Debian (github#13, @medusacle).

* Bug fixes:
  github#1   -c none produces pointless \e[0m after every line (found by
             Adam Borowski).
  github#3   Compile error (found by Lajos Papp).
  github#4   AM_PROG_LIBTOOL is obsolete, replace it with LT_INIT
             (Robert-Andr√© Mauchin).
  github#5   Port chafa to i386 architecture (Mo Zhou).
  github#7   Chafa should not return an error when being asked for
             --version (Mo Zhou).
  github#10  Fix detection of MagickWand methods (Felix Yan).
  github#11  ImageMagick 7 support (found by Felix Yan).
  github#21  chafa.c:547: pointless assignment (found by @dcb314).

0.9.0 (2018-04-24)
